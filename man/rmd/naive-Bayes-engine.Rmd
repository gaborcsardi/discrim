# Engine Details

Engines may have pre-set default arguments when executing the model fit call. For this type of model, the template of the fit calls are:

\pkg{klaR}

```{r klaR}
naive_Bayes() %>% 
  set_engine("klaR") %>% 
  translate()
```


\pkg{naivebayes}

```{r naivebayes}
naive_Bayes() %>% 
  set_engine("naivebayes") %>% 
  translate()
```

The standardized parameter names in parsnip can be mapped to their original names in each engine that has main parameters:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
parsnip::convert_args("naive_Bayes")
```

Note that `usekernel` is always set to `TRUE` for the `klaR` engine. This model does not need to make dummy variables from factor predictors. However, if `parsnip::fit()` is used to fit the model, dummy variables _would_ be created while `parsnip::fit_xy()` will preserve the factor predictors in their original encoding.
