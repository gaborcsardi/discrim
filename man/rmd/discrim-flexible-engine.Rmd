# Engine Details

Engines may have pre-set default arguments when executing the model fit call. For this type of model, the template of the fit calls are:

\pkg{earth}

```{r earth}
discrim_flexible() %>% 
  set_engine("earth") %>% 
  translate()
```


The standardized parameter names in parsnip can be mapped to their original names in each engine that has main parameters:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
parsnip::convert_args("discrim_flexible")
```
